    <h2>Burry Man</h2>
    <p>The burry man is a local man that is covered head to toe in sticky burs only leaving his shoes, hand and two eye holes exposed. On the top layer he wears a sash, flowers and a floral hat and he holds two staves. His ability to bend his arms or sit down is very restricted during the long day and his progress is a slow walk with frequent pauses. Two locals in ordinary clothes assist him throughout the process, helping him hold the staves, guiding his route whilst enthusiastic children go from door-to-door collecting money on his behalf. </p>
